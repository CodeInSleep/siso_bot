Three Gates:
  1. Forget Gate Layer(sigmoid) - decide what information we're going to throw away from the cell state
  2. Input Gate Layer(sigmoid) - decides which values we'll update
	(tanh) - creates new candidate cell state
  3. Output Gate Layer(tanh+sigmoid) - pass cell state through tanh (values to be between -1 and 1) and
	multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate to output parts we decide to.


Assumptions we do not make:
  1. that the robot is going to behave ideally, hence our commands on the robot 
	(without any control components) will deviate from the ideal course.
  2.  


Additional things we can do:
  1. Add controller (such as MPC) onto the robot to control the robot movement
